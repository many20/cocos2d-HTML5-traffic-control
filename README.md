A simple "Traffic Control" style game written using cocos2d-HTML5

The version of cocos2d-HTML5 that is compatible with the game code has been added as a sub project 
to guarantee that the game should function correctly.

Note. If you are downloading the Zip file, GitHub doesn't automatcially bundle the cocos2d-html5 subproject into 
the Zip file.
You need to click on the subproject and then download the zip for cocos2d-html5.
Unzip the cocos2d-html5 and rename it to replace the empty cocos2d-html5 folder created by the
Traffic Control master Zip file.
